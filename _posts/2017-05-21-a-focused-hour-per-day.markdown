A few months ago, I came across a [post on Medium](https://medium.com/the-mission/the-power-of-one-focused-hour-a-day-22e4851f89b1), which explained how we can change our lives just by doing any work for a  **full focused hour a day**. No doubt why that article got tens of thousands of likes, because it actually made sense.

Instead of complaining about shortage of time, why don't we keep all our devices off, distractions aside and priorities sorted for that one golden hour, where we build our maximum focus and get our work done.

Of course, you can't climb Mount Everest in one hour, but you surely can, for example, learn to cook a new dish, understand a programming language, or even finish your pending assignment. The idea is to **give your best in every second for those 3600 seconds**. Though you can go more if you have better mileage.

Remember, form is temporary but class is permanent. Don't exhaust yourself when you're over-enthusiatic about work. Divide your work properly and get the maximum work done when you're focused.

Set a timeline (not deadlines) and distribute your work, and remind yourself everyday about your goals and resolutions and why they matter to you.

Never skip. If not an hour, even 10 minutes would help you to maintain your pace.<br>Go with your convinence, but don't let that one focused hour waste.

Keeping this in mind, enjoy what you have got.

Good Bye!
