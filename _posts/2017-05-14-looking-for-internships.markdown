Lately I have been searching various job portals for Internships.

No, I am not looking for jobs; This is a part of my college's summer assessment process and for this, we have to do internships in a company.

It has been a really busy month for me. My exams started in mid-April continued till 13th May, leaving me with almost 6 hours of sleep and a couple of hours to relax from entire day after study, each day.

The college said that internship should start by 22nd May and end by somewhere around first week of July. This makes me worry, as my first stage of finding a suitable organization is yet to be done. Then other formalities would also take 2-3 days.

Because I am a web developer, I am looking for developing websites at back-end through MEAN stack. Though the job portal has hundreds of internships posted each day, none of them fits my criteria. The _not_ so good thing about people here is that they actually don't know what they want in intern.

I see many of the jobs description have absurd combinations of requirements. I believe they just click on skills suggestion otherwise you won't see a combined requirement of "Java, Python, PHP, MongoDB, MYSQL, HTML and Javascript" for a 6 week internship.

Anyway, my motto of doing internship is not just to collect the certificates, but to learn and implement my knowledge at professional level and strengthn my skills.

Hope I would get a satisfcatory internship on time, so I can focus on building the best product.

Have a nice day folks.
