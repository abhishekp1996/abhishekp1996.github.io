So, finally it's done! The time is 0100 hours now.

Finally I have installed Jekyll. I have a working static blog on my local machine as well as on remote github repository, `github.io/abhishekp1996/`

Now, I am actually quite happy about it. Having heard of Jekyll name from a long time now, I couldn't resist to rock with my own blog. I have seen many live examples of Jekyll based blogs and now it was time for mine.

Without much knowledge of cmd commands, even the basics `cd`, I landed onto tutorials that were way too brief. I did install Jekyll, but the broken Jekyll. I searched internet for how to fix and because of the lack of shell scripting knowledge, it was difficult for me to continue... and therefore I gave up.

I did came across Jekyll few months later, and again few unsuccessful tries.

This time, I finally decided "Once and for all". And yes, I did it. But, there was an update in me. Now I knew _git_, _cmd commands_, had a prior _npm experience_. So it all helped me to set up first static blog.

It seems a milestone to me. I am not a programming wizard, just above average. So yes, I too get happy when I do something sort of _genius_ things, like the Jekyll installation.

Hope I am going to continue this blog till the end of my life.

Tomorrow, I will design a new theme for it. Add up with more stories of my life. My projects and everything worth sharing.

Have a great day!
