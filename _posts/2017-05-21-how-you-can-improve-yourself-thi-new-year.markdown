A year changes a lot. I find this fact honest but not practical.

We all are humans. We all live on Earth, scattered over continents, segregated into countries.

But we all celebrate a common single but largest event every year. It's the **New Year**. Some say it's the first event in every year and others say it's the last. The former one sounds more optimistic though.

 The next thing which is common between all of us is we all make resolutions, mostly unreaslistic. Like, how many people are there who actually act on them?

You are super-human if you do -- I apologise you wouldn't be able to relate much with this post. If you are human like me, we can figure out where we need improvement.

The problem lies not in the way how human psychology works, but the practicality of resolution.

If your goals are to reduce weight, you might end up with no change at all, and this is where we need to find that hidden peice which will help us complete the puzzle.

## A focused hour per day...

A few months ago, I came across a [post on Medium](https://medium.com/the-mission/the-power-of-one-focused-hour-a-day-22e4851f89b1), which explained how we can change our lives just by doing any work for a  **full focused hour a day**. No doubt why that article got tens of thousands of likes, because it actually made sense.

Instead of complaining about shortage of time, why don't we keep all our devices off, distractions aside and priorities sorted for that one golden hour, where we build our maximum focus and get our work done.

Of course, you can't climb Mount Everest in one hour, but you surely can, for example, learn to cook a new dish, understand a programming language, or even finish your pending assignment. The idea is to **give your best in every second for those 3600 seconds**. Though you can go more if you have better mileage.

## Don't count days but your goals -

Form is temporary but class is permanent. Don't exhaust yourself when you're over-enthusiatic about work. Divide your work properly and get the maximum work done when you're focused.

Set a timeline (not deadlines) and distribute your work, and remind yourself everyday about your goals and resolutions and why they matter to you.

Never skip. If not an hour, even 10 minutes would help you to maintain your pace.<br>Go with your convinence, but don't let that one focused hour waste.

## Set aside a time for yourself :

If you are like me, you probably spend most of your time with yourself and with my experience, it works very well. I see myself as my competition, and becoming better than yesterday is what I aim for today.

Our goals may be same, but everyone has different journey. Becoming self aware is an important thing to progress ahead in life and to connect with yourself you need to spend time with yourself.

## ...

Summing it up, the new year's excitment is at par. The year is even more interesting because I will be working, earning for my living and family along with all the luxuries of an independent person.

One good thing about time is it changes, and changes everything with it. I have already embarked on the journey of becoming a better person. Following the above one hour focused rule, I was able to write this blog post. Hope the streak continues.

Have a very Happy New Year, 2018.

Good Bye!
