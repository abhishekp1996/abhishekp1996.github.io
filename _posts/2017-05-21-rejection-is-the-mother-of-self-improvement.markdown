I haven't heard of this before, but it is important to quote it. A quotation looks good when given some CSS styling. Here, it reads better.

> Rejection is the mother of Self Improvement

Rejection is tough. It's even more when you get rejected in something you are good at. A similar experience happened with me today.

I have been [looking for internships lately]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-05-14-looking-for-internships %}) as a part of my college assessment process.

I had been shortlisted for one of those applications. I needed to pass an interview before getting the internship confirmation. I was quite excited about it, but I gave the interview being the stupidest I can be at that moment.

Eventually, they rejected me.

I can't blame anyone other than me. The interview was for a MEAN stack based job. The issue was that I recently switched to MEAN stack from LAMP stack, about two months ago.

Wait, there's more to explain before you judge the *two months* time span.

The problem were my end-year examinations that continued for entire 1 month. It's not that I haven't learned MEAN, but whatever I learnt had disappeared from my brain, and I was quite blank in the interview. So, it's somewhere my fault that I haven't gave it time.

Coming back to the *now*, I am more dedicated and determined to learn and explore MEAN. I want to improve, I want the self-improvement in me in terms of skills. Today's rejection event will always play an important role in my life because I have never been rejected based on my skills.

I am not depressed or sad. Surprisingly, I am happy and feeling refreshed, ready to dive in books and tutorials to learn this *MEAN*.

Hopefully, this would bring some change in me. I will try to be better than myself.

Good Bye!
